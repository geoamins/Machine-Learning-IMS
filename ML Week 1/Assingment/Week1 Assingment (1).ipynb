    "# Assignment 2: Creating a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "You will create a Python function named `process_scores` that takes a list of student scores as an argument and returns a dictionary with the following information:\n",
    "- Average score\n",
    "- Highest score\n",
    "- Lowest score\n",
    "- A list of letter grades for each student score based on the average score\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Complete the Assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Function**:\n",
    "   Define a function named `process_scores` that takes a list of integers (student scores) as its parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the Average Score**:\n",
    "   Inside the function, calculate the average score of the students.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find the Highest and Lowest Scores**:\n",
    "   Determine the highest and lowest scores in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Assign Letter Grades**:\n",
    "   Based on the average score, assign letter grades to each student using the following criteria:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - A: score >= 90\n",
    "   - B: 80 <= score < 90\n",
    "   - C: 70 <= score < 80\n",
    "   - D: 60 <= score < 70\n",
    "   - F: score < 60   \n",
    "   (Hint: You will need to implement a loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return a Dictionary**:\n",
    "   Return a dictionary containing the average score, highest score, lowest score, and the list of letter grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Test the Function**:\n",
    "   Write a test case to verify that your function works as expected."
